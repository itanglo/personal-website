          My name is Paolo Di Pasquale and this is my personal website. It&apos;s for writing and
          capturing lots of different stuff including, but not limited to my work as a web engineer.
          My domain name is &quot;itanglo.io&quot;, it&apos;s a play on words that refers to my
          mixed heritage. My late father was Italian and my mother is English. I was born in Italy
          and moved over to England with my family when I was 8 years old. This makes me an Italian
          Anglo, or &quot;Itanglo&quot;. The top level domain of &quot;.io&quot;, has the fortunate
          coincidence that &quot;io&quot; means &quot;me&quot; in Italian.
